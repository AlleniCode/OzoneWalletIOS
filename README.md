# O<sub>3</sub>

O<sub>3</sub> (pronounced Ozone) is a mobile gateway to the NEO smart economy. It is backed by [neo-swift](https://github.com/cityofzion/neo-swift), which gives it the ability to perform read and write operations on the NEO blockchain.

O<sub>3</sub> is primarily designed to be used as a hot wallet, which isolates the majority of your digital assets from security risks, but still allows for convenient access to your "hot assets" on a daily basis.

## Current Status

O<sub>3</sub> can currently be considered as pre-release software; we encourage everyone to FIRST experiment on the test network, and then graduate to using the main network. Operations on the Main Network will be permanent, and these should be done at your own risk. 

## Roadmap

We envison O<sub>3</sub> to be the premier mobile client for the NEO ecosystem. In the future we want to support invoking smart contracts, storing other digital assets, NEP-5 compatible tokens, while making it secure and easy to use for an average user.
